# 1. Overview
------

The Open Storefront application is a software cataloging system that is used to catalog components
of interest to the DI2E community. Components include Government off
the shelf (GOTS), commercial off the shelf (COTS), and Open Source
software (OSS). The component evaluations done by DI2E's Centers of
Excellence are displayed in the Storefront and give details on the
following:

-   Ownership
-   Where/How to access the software
-   Software vitals
-   Conformance
-   Links to documentation, source code and other artifacts
-   Evaluation information

**Open Storefront is developed by Space Dynamics Laboratory for DI2E and is
licensed under Apache V2.**

# 2.  User Features
------

The features that are available to users to be able to access the information in a variety of ways.

##   2.1  Searching
------


Storefront Search provides a way to find component lists and articles
matching search criteria. Several types of searches are supported. The
types of searches that can be performed are:

1.  Searching across multiple fields (component name and description,
    tags, attribute types, codes, and descriptions)

2.  Wildcard searching (\* and ?)

3.  Exact phrase searching

4.  Case insensitivity

**Note:** The type ahead on the search field only looks at the title to see if  it contains the text.  
The user can then select the suggestion by clicking on it or continue with a full text search.

### 2.1.1 Search Field Differentiation or Specificity
-------

Currently, there is no differentiation among Component Name, Component
Description, Tags, or Attributes as to the preference, specificity, or
coverage of the search. A search term or phrase is searched via a single
search box, and applied across all fields equally. Advanced search per a
specific field is not currently available.

### 2.1.2 Fuzzy Matching and Wildcards
------

Fuzzy matching is defined as the ability to perform inexact matches on
terms in the search index. For example, this could be used to find all
variations of prefixed or suffixed words and multiple spellings of a
word.

Fuzzy matching is done with the \* and the ? characters acting as
wildcards. It is also known as wildcard searching. The \* character
represents a string of letters; whereas the ? acts as a placeholder for
only a single character. The process works as shown in the queries
below:

Query: offi\* Matches office, officer, official, and so on

Query: off\*r Matches offer, officer, officiator, and so on

Query: off?r Matches offer, but not officer

### 2.1.3 Phrase Searches and Exact Searches
------

Exact searches must be enclosed by double quotes.

Search example: "create a common framework"

Wildcards are only meant to work on individual search terms, not on
phrase searches / exact searches, as demonstrated by this example:

Works: softwar\* eng?neering

Does not work: "softwar\* eng?neering"

In the second example, the search would only return results that had the
\* and ? characters exactly in their respective places instead of
accepting any character in those locations as the user intended.

### 2.1.4 Case Insensitivity
------

Searching is case **insensitive** and allows mixing of case. In the
examples below, the exact same results would be returned regardless of
the capitalization.

Search examples: "create a common framework" **OR** "Create a Common
Framework"

Search examples: create common framework **OR** cReatE CoMmoN
FraMewoRk

### 2.1.5 Noise Words
------

Avoid searching with noise words, unless they are part of a
double-quote-enclosed exact phrase search. Some common noise words
include: a, an, and, are, as, at, be, but, by, for, if, in, into, is,
it, no, not, of, on, or, such, that, the, their, then, there, these,
they, this, to, was, will, with.

Search example: create a common framework

This search works, but the 'a' will return more results than are desired
since results with the word 'a' will be returned in the search.

Search example: create common framework

This search works, and will return fewer, more specific results. It will
return *only* those places where the three words *create*, *common*,
and *framework* are found.

The only time that including noise words may be recommended is when
performing an exact search and the words are a necessary part of the
phrase being searched. For more information on exact searches, see
section 1.1.3.

## 2.1.6 SvcV-4  **Make a section for the new search from home page?**
------

SvcV-4 is a DI2E architecture taxonomy. The application provides
functionality to search for listing by SvcV-4 taxonomy.

A user may use this feature to look for capabilities that are available
in the DI2E community.

**To search by SvcV-4:**

1.  Go to home page

2.  Click on SvcV-4

3.  Navigate the search tree on the left and the application will show
    the description of the taxonomy and the related search results.

**NOTE:** All child branches are searched. (Eg. 1.2 …will also show
1.2.1, 1.2.2…etc)

## 2.1.7 Filtering 
---------

Filters are applied to a set of search results from the search results
page.

Here is a list of filters that may be applied:

Available Filters

-   *By Text*     - Filters results by the title of the listing.
-   *By Tag*      - Filters results by matching tags
-   *By Rating*   -  Filters results by User Review Rating
-   *By Attribute*  - Filters results by the listing the match the selected Attributes (Vitals).

about storefront.  There are four main sections in the dashboard: Entry Statistics, Notifications, 
User Statistics, and System Statistics.


## 3.2 Data Management
--------

### 3.2.1 Attributes
-------

#### 3.2.1.2 Types *
------

Attribute Types represent a related group of specific categories or
represent a single attribute of a listing (Eg. "Funded" would be a type
with the corresponding value "Yes" or "No"). A type may have many codes.  

Deleting a type will delete the associated codes and component
attributes. Inactivating a type will inactivate associated data such as
component attributes.

**NOTE**: Avoid "/" and special characters in type codes. For example,
use: \[A-Z\]\[0-9\].

**To add or edit a type:**

1.  From the Attribute Tool, click on the **Add** or the
    **Edit** button.

2.  Fill in the form.

**NOTE:** The Attribute Type Code field should be all caps and should not
contain spaces or "/".

3.  Save the form and you can proceed to editing the codes for the type.

**To export a type:**

1.  Select which types to export.

2.  Click **Export**.

Exports are in JSON format and contain the type and all related codes.

**To import a type:**

1.  Use the Attribute File Import.

2.  Click **Import**.

3.  Select an Attribute File. This should be a JSON attribute file.

4.  Click **Upload**.

 The Import will be processed in the background. The task notification
 area next to the user menu will indicate when the import task has
 completed.

 The processing behavior is: for every code not in the import, the
 existing code will be inactivated. If the code already exists and
 doesn't match, then it will be updated. For code that matches, the
 code in the file will not be processed. If a type doesn't exist, a new
 one will be created. If the type matches, it will be updated. Other
 existing types not found in the file will not be affected.

**Importing SvcV-4:**

1.  Use SvcV-4 import.

2.  Make sure the SvcV-4 file is in the correct format (CVS) and it
    contains the correct columns. (See warning on upload for the
    expected fields)

3.  Select a SvcV-4 import file.

4.  Click **Upload**.

 **WARNING:** UID in the file should match what is stored in application.
    The application support both 1 and 0001 matching to 1.

Processing behavior works the same as the Attribute import process.

### 3.2.1.3 Codes *
------

An attribute code is a specific category value that can be applied to a
component. For example: Component listing may contain and attribute for

### 3.2.3 Entry Types
------

### 3.2.4 Highlights
-------

### 3.2.5 Integrations
-------

Component Integration allows for pulling information from an external
system and mapping that back to a component in the application. This
allows for automatic sync of the data source. Currently the application
only supports integration with Jira.

**To setup a Jira Integration:**

1.  Navigate to Integration Management Admin Tool using the admin
    navigation menu.

**Add Mappings:**

1.  Select Jira Project.
2.  Select Issue Type.
3.  Select Attribute in application.
4.  Select Jira field to which to map.
5.  Create mapping by moving them from the available list to
        attribute codes.
6.  Click **Save**.

 **NOTE:** More than one field in JIRA can be mapped to an attribute
        code.

**Add Configuration:**

1.  Create a new Configuration by clicking **Add** on the Component
    Configuration tab.
2.  Select a Component.
3.  Click **Add**
4.  Select JIRA Project (only projects with mappings will be available).
5.  Enter the Jira Issue Number (Eg. ASSET-14)
6.  Click **Save**.

The Component Job will be scheduled when it's saved. The job will run on
an interval based on the global refresh rate. The default is once a day
at 10:00 am server time. The component configuration table will show
when the integration last ran. Also, the scheduled integration job can
be viewed using the Jobs Tool by clicking **Show Integration Jobs**.

The Integration Tool allows for manual control. However, it's not
necessary to run the integration manually as the automated job will
handle that.

If the integration fails for any reason, the configuration table will so
indicate and an error ticket will be created for further analysis. The
integration may fail if the server it's connecting to is unavailable.
This may be a temporary condition. The system will try again on the next
interval. If the configuration job continues to have issues it may
deactivated manually using the tools and then reactivated when the issue
is resolved.

### 3.2.6 Imports

### 3.2.9 User Data
---------
Every user in the system has a user profile.  A user profile contains information
about the user and their user specific settings.   The initial creation of the profile
at first login will contain the information gathered from the external security application.

#### 3.2.9.1 Creation *
------

The application doesn't directly manage user-only profiles. When a user
first securely logs in, a profile is created. It's up to the applicable
security utility (Open AM, LDAP, Database…etc.) to define the users.

#### 3.2.9.2 Messaging *
------

Users can message other users using User Profiles. The message will be
emailed to the email address listed in their profile.

**To message a user or a group of users:**

1.  Navigate to the User Profiles Tool.

2.  Click on the message icon ![mail](../../../../../../client/openstorefront/app/images/help/mail.png) next to the user
    (or users) that you want to message.

3.  Fill out the form.

4.  Click **Send** to send the message immediately.

**NOTE:** Messages are sent to email addresses one at a time so no email
addresses are leaked to other users.

#### 3.2.9.3 Control *
------

An admin may edit, activate or inactivate a profile. Inactivating a
profile does not prevent login. Upon login, the user's profile will be
reactivated. Once a profile has been inactivated, that user's watches
and messages are also inactivated. Reactivating the profile will
activate the user's existing watches, but it won't send any previous
messages – just messages going forward.

**To toggle active status:**

1.  Navigate to User Profiles Tool.

2.  Click on the activate/inactivate ![toggle](../../../../../../client/openstorefront/app/images/help/toggle.png) icon and use
    the filter option to view active/inactive users.


## 3.3 Application Management
--------

### 3.3.1 Alerts
------

Alerts are triggers set up to watch the data that an administrator can
subscribe to. This allows for "reactive" administration of the
application by setting up alerts when events occur in the system. The
application will monitor the data as it flows in and trigger alerts that
have been setup.

Descriptions of Alert Triggers:

-  **Component Submission** - Alerts on component submissions and cancellations.
-  **System Error**         - Alerts on system error according to trigger options.
-  **User Data**            - Alerts on user data changes according to trigger options.

**To set up an Alert:**

1.  Navigate to the Alerts Tool.

2.  Click **Add**.

3.  Fill in the form and select an Alert Type.

4.  Select any appropriate report options.

5.  Click **Save**.

**To cancel an Alert:**

1.  Navigate to the Alerts Tool.

    ![trash](../../../../../../client/openstorefront/app/images/help/trash.png) to cancel the scheduled report. Click
    **Inactivate** to temporarily pause it.
	

### 3.3.2 Jobs
------
The Jobs Tool allows for viewing and managing both scheduled background
jobs and background tasks. An Admin can use the tool to pause, start,
and run scheduled jobs. This tool helps in troubleshooting and view of
the status of the application. If an operation is known to potentially
run for an extended period of time, then it will process in the
background allowing for faster feedback to the user while the operation
completes. Scheduled jobs that run periodically such as the notification
job also run in the background to provide automatic handling of
services.

### 3.3.3 Reports
------

Descriptions of the Reports:

-  **Component**        - Reports on a component's statistics
-  **Link Validation** - Checks all component links and verifies the status of the links to determine potentially bad links.
-  **Organization**   -  Reports on organization's statistics based on information in user profiles. The report attempts to group users by an organization.
-  **Usage**            -  Reports on the application's usage statistics for a specified time period.
-  **User**             - Reports on user statistics (views, logins, etc.)

A report can be either manually generated on demand or set to
auto-generate according to a specific schedule.

### 3.3.4 System
------
System Tools are provided to aid in troubleshooting.

System Tools and their Purpose:

-  **Search Control** -           Allows for re-indexing listings
-  **Recent Changes Email** -     Allows for sending/previewing a recent change email.
-  **Error Tickets** -            View error tickets generated by the system and view their details.
-  **Application Properties** -   Can be used to adjust application run state.
-  **System Configuration** -     Provides a read-only view in the current properties.
-  **Logging** -                  Allows for adjusting log levels at run time to log more/less information from a software component. **NOTE:** Logs are hierarchically organized so set a level from a parent will affect all children who are set to delegate to the parent logger. Loggers under: edu.usu.sdl.openstorefront are application specific. A logger will only appear when the software component is loaded.
-  **Status** -                   Shows the run status of the application (i.e. memory, load, thread status and properties). Refer to Java platform documentation for the interpretation of the information.


### 3.3.5 Tracking

The application tracks internal user logins, Component/Resources views,
and Article views. The application also can be integrated with external
analytics such as google analytics for additional information. Also, the
application server can be configured for access logging and the
application logs audit message for all admin API access.

The primary tracking events can be viewed using the Tracking Admin Tool.
As well as the events are aggregated into various system generated
report accessible via the Reports Admin Tool.

### 3.5 Resources *  **PUT THIS UNDER SUBMISSIONS?**
------

Resources are links to documentation, the home page, sources, etc. that
are related to the component. Resources are typically external, however,
they can be hosted locally.

**To add a resource:**

1.  Navigate to the Component Tool.

2.  Click on the **Edit** icon ![edit](../../../../../../client/openstorefront/app/images/help/edit.png) on the component.

3.  Click the **Resources** tab.

4.  Fill in the form and upload a file or enter in an external link, but
    not both.

**NOTE:** You can edit, activate/inactive, or delete a resource.
Inactivating makes it not visible to the users. However, the resource is
still there so it can be reactivated.

### 3.6 Media *  **PUT THIS UNDER SUBMISSIONS?**
------

Media provides visual/audio descriptions of the component. A common
example is a screenshot. Media is typically hosted locally and
previewers for common types are available. However, media can also be
hosted externally.

**To add media:**

1.  Navigate to the Component Tool.

2.  Click on the **Edit** icon ![edit](../../../../../../client/openstorefront/app/images/help/edit.png) on the component.

3.  Click the **Media** tab.

4.  Fill in the form and either upload a file or enter in an external
    link, but not both.

**NOTE:** You can edit, activate/inactive, or delete. Inactivating make
it not visible to the users. However, the media is still there so it can
be reactivated.

### 3.7 Evaluation *  **PUT THIS UNDER SUBMISSIONS?**
------

Components may be evaluated and, if so, that evaluation information may
be captured on the component so that it can be displayed to the user.
Right now, only evaluation sections can have a score associated with
them.

**To add/update evaluation scores to a component:**

1.  Navigate to the Component Tool.

2.  Click on the **Edit** icon ![edit](../../../../../../client/openstorefront/app/images/help/edit.png) on the component.

3.  Click the Evaluation Information tab.

4.  Enter in the scores or mark **Not Applicable**.

**NOTE:** A section can have no value which allows for controlling which
evaluation section shows for a component. For example, if a new section
is added, existing components would show their existing evaluation
sections until a value is entered. The existing column shows the value
that is currently saved, if any. To remove the value click the delete
![trash](../../../../../../client/openstorefront/app/images/help/trash.png) icon.


### 3.8 Badges *
------

Allow associating an image with a specific code value. Badges show up on
listings and can be used as visual indication that a component meets a
specific criteria. Badges are referenced using a URL that URL can be
internal (setup by using the Media Tool) or external which allows for
dynamic badges. Internal Media is referred to by name so that switching
images can be accomplished with having to manually update all links.

**To add a badge to an attribute code:**

1.  Navigate to the Media Tool.

2.  Click **Add**.

3.  Fill out the form and upload image. (Note that SVG may need to be
    adjusted to be used by IE. Typically, this involves adjusting the
    viewport attributes so the image scales properly.)

4.  Select and copy the Resource URL.

5.  Navigate to the Attributes Tool.

6.  Edit Type and then edit the Code to which the badge applies.

7.  Paste the URL into the Badge URL field.

8.  Click **Save**.

**To add a badge to a component:**

1.  Navigate to the Component Tool.

2.  Click on the **Edit** icon ![edit](../../../../../../client/openstorefront/app/images/help/edit.png) on the component.

3.  Select **Attributes** tab.

4.  Add the attribute by selecting the type and code with the badge.

### 3.9 Highlighting *
------

Highlighting allows specific code to be visually highlighted in the
application. If a particular value is determined to be desirable, it may
be highlighted in green, or if a value represents something the user
should be cautioned about then it may be red. Highlighting allows an
admin to apply that behavior to a value.

**To apply Highlighting to an attribute:**

1.  Navigate to the Attributes Tool.

2.  Edit Type and then edit the Code to which the highlighting should
    be applied.

3.  Select desired highlight color from the dropdown.

4.  Click **Save**.

### 3.4.1 Managing *
------

Articles are tied to specific categories (Attribute Type and Code). This
allows for filtering and association with components. Articles are only
visible when the Attribute Code associated with the article is active.
Any attribute code may have an article associated with it.

**To create an article:**

1.  Click **Create Article** from the Article Tool.

2.  Select the Type and Code with which the article should
    be associated.

3.  Enter a Title for the article. This will be shown as the title in
    the search results.

4.  Enter a short description of the article to be displayed in the
    search results.

5.  Enter the Article using the rich text editor.

6.  Click **Save** when ready to publish the article. It will be
    immediately viewable by users. Use **Preview** to view changes
    before saving.

**NOTE:** Clicking **Export** will export selected articles to a JSON
file which can be imported using the Import Tool. On import, the matched
Type and Code articles will update existing and non-matched will create
new articles. Any internal images in the articles will need to be
manually set up using the Media Tool in-order for them to be displayed.

### 3.4.2 Media *
------

Adding media (specific images) to an article can be accomplished by
first adding the media using the Media Tool. The URL can then be copied
and used in an article by using the Rich Text Edit Tools.

### 3.4.3 Component Lists *
------

The contents of an article may be mostly HTML tags (the Edit Tool
defines the available formatting options). It may also contain a special
widget that shows a list of components matching an admin-defined set of
criteria. Beware of copying and pasting values into the component list
configuration form. It can introduce errors that are hidden in the form
and are only visible by using the **Source** button of the editor. Only
**Title**, **Type** and **Code** need to be set; the other options are
for advanced cases only.

## 3.5 Watches *
-------

The user can create watches that can send notifications to the user. The
messages that the watches generate are viewable from the User Message
Tool. The User Message Tool allows for queued messages to be processed
after a delayed time period. The queue delay allows for messages to be
pooled by type thereby reducing the amount of emails rapid changes can
create. The User Message can also be used to view previously sent
messages in cases of troubleshooting whether the system sent a
notification or not. The tools also allow for manually processing the
queue immediately, but in most cases this is not needed or desired as
the automatic process will take handling the message queue.

Watches can be placed on Components or Articles by selecting either in
the drop-down "Component Type" in the General tab when editing or adding
a component.

**NOTE:** Other user messages besides watches, such as alerts, flow
through the message queue as well.
