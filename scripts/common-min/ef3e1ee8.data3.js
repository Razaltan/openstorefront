The result is a continuous stream of video frames georegistered to an underlying digital elevation map and reference imagery or to Digital Point Positioning Data Base (DPPDB) reference products.  Any frame in the video stream can be used for precision targeting or other precision position extraction applications.  \n\nThe frames are also crudely mosaicked (i.e. they are all correctly geopositioned but may still have visible \"seams\" from small scene intensity changes during the collection).  These visible seams can be removed by a subsequent FMV mosaicking process that blends image intensities across frame boundaries.\n\nThe FMV georegistration service ingests a stream of FMV frames and either reference imagery with associated reference DEMs or reference DPPDB.  If the quality of the FMV collection metadata is poor (such as is common from small UAVs or mini UAVs), the FMV georegistration service can optionally ingest point correspondences between the 1st frame in the FMV stream and the reference imagery in order to initiate the georegistration process.\n\nOnce the process starts, the service updates the FMV collection metadata for every frame based on a Kalman filter estimation of sensor position and attitude that is augmented by periodic automatic extractions of matching point correspondences between selected frames and the reference imagery.",

  "TagNotes_Service Definition":"Image Rectification provides transformations to project two or more images onto a common image or geocoordinate plane.",
  "TagNotes_Service Description":"Rectification is a process of geometrically correcting an image so that it can be represented on a planar surface with a standard coordinate system.  This is often done to make an image geometrically conform to other images acquired from other perspectives.  This supports applications such as image/video mosaicking (combining multiple photographic images with overlapping fields of view to produce a larger, apparently seamless image), change detection, and multisensor data fusion.\n\nIt is also done to make an image or multiple images conform to a map, often for geographic information system (GIS) purposes. A common method for this service is to associate geolocations with pixels on an image.  The image pixels are then resampled to place them in into a common map coordinate system. \n\nAnother important application in which a rectification service gets used is in performing an epipolar rectification to ensure that corresponding match points in a pair of stereo images are displaced only along a single axis.  This enables easier matching and analysis of corresponding points in stereo image pairs by reducing the pixel stereo offsets to lie entirely along a single preferred axis (the epipolar axis).\n\nThe Image rectification Service ingests at a minimum an image, and a description of the planar surface to be used in the rectification process.  In some instances, such as for epipolar rectification, the target planar surface is described entirely by a second image in a stereo pair.  Automatic point correspondence matching establishes the required rectification transformation.  In other instances, such as orthorectification, it is common to supply either a reference image and a corresponding digital elevation map (DEM) or a reference image pair such as is found in a Digital Point Positioning Data Base (DPPDB). The DEM is used in performing the rectification transformation to minimize unsightly image artifacts that can affect a rectification done on perspective images in cases where no information about underlying terrain is supplied.  The simplest input to a rectification service is an input image to be rectified with image support data and a specification of a horizontal plane surface.",

For example, encryption-in-transit is required for many types of data.  An encryption service, for these types of data, would create a chicken-and-egg problem: data must be encrypted before it can be sent to the encryption service, but the encryption service must do the encryption.  In this example, the encryption libraries will likely be resident on the system that generates the sensitive data.

Recent conversation on DIB Hub related to GUIDE https://forum.macefusion.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=150 \n\nNote that this has been one of the key areas of focus of the IC ITE effort... after much painful negotiation, a standard was agreed to by the IC community... every discrete piece of intelligence product is supposed to be tagged with a GUIDE ID at its earliest point of consumability (if not sooner!)... the GUIDE ID is an extension/variation of CIA's original implementation of this.  In particular, an IC ITE GUIDE ID has two parts: a prefix and a suffix.  The prefix is an arbitrary number that will be assigned to an Intel producing organization (agency) by the TIC (an existing ODNI group)... an agency may end up having several assigned prefix numbers, perhaps dedicated to particular product types or producing systems.  The suffix can be assigned in one of two ways. The preferred approach is to use one of the available industry standard random generators to assign a 32 hex-character number (which is usually displayed as a 36-character string, after inserting 4 hyphens, at standard locations, to break up the hex number for readability reasons), the other (optional) approach is to assign some other unique string value, with the proviso that this string has to be unique (when combined with the associated prefix value), and with the proviso that the string cannot be of substantive intelligence significance (i.e., you can't use a BE Number or some other well-known intelligence-related code, because this value, by itself, must be meaningless).\n\nThe IC is going to force Intel producers to start assigning these things, so the ScvV-4 should align with this, rather than allowing some kind of variant of this approach."

For business applications, data validation can be defined through declarative data integrity rules, or procedure-based business rules. Data that does not conform to these rules will negatively affect business process execution. Therefore, data validation should start with business process definition and set of business rules within this process. Rules can be collected through the requirements capture exercise. The simplest data validation verifies that the characters provided come from a valid set. For example, that data stored as YYYYMMDDHHMM have exactly 12 digits and  the MM is between 01 and 12 inclusive. A more sophisticated data validation routine would check to see the user had entered a valid country code, i.e., that the number of digits entered matched the convention for the country or area specified.

Web Map Service operations can be invoked using a standard web browser by submitting requests in the form of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). The content of such URLs depends on which operation is requested. In particular, when requesting a map the URL indicates what information is to be shown on the map, what portion of the Earth is to be mapped, the desired coordinate reference system, and the output image width and height. When two or more maps are produced with the same geographic parameters and output size, the results can be accurately overlaid to produce a composite map. The use of image formats that support transparent backgrounds (e.g. GIF or PNG) allows underlying maps to be visible. Furthermore, individual maps can be requested from different servers.

Real objects are also typically divided into two abstractions: discrete objects (e.g., a house) and continuous fields (such as rainfall amount, or elevations). \n\nCommon GIS display operations include:\n• contrast enhancement and color rendering \n• geographic data conversion\n• map integration and image rectification \n• complex spatial modeling \n• geometric network representation\n• hydrological modeling\n• Digital Elevation Model (DEM) assessment\n• data extraction\n• Geostatistics that analyze point-patterns and provide predictions\n• Digital cartography\n• Topological relationships (adjacency, containment, proximity, ..)\n• Surface interpolation using various mathematical models \n• Geocoding (interpolating spatial locations from street addresses or any other spatially referenced data using reference themes).\n• Spatial Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tools",

In particular, an IC ITE GUIDE ID has two parts: a prefix and a suffix.  The prefix is an arbitrary number that will be assigned to an Intel producing organization (agency) by the TIC (an existing ODNI group)... an agency may end up having several assigned prefix numbers, perhaps dedicated to particular product types or producing systems.  The suffix can be assigned in one of two ways. The preferred approach is to use one of the available industry standard random generators to assign a 32 hex-character number (which is usually displayed as a 36-character string, after inserting 4 hyphens, at standard locations, to break up the hex number for readability reasons), the other (optional) approach is to assign some other unique string value, with the proviso that this string has to be unique (when combined with the associated prefix value), and with the proviso that the string cannot be of substantive intelligence significance (i.e., you can't use a BE Number or some other well-known intelligence-related code, because this value, by itself, must be meaningless).\n\nThe IC is going to force Intel producers to start assigning these things, so the ScvV-4 should align with this, rather than allowing some kind of variant of this approach."

This includes both symmetric and asymmetric crypto functions, one-way hashing functions, management of encryption keys, digital signature verification, and validation of PKI certificates.  The services within this family may not be discrete, stand-alone services as one would picture in the traditional SOA sense; rather, many Cryptography Management services are likely to be libraries or executables that are embedded within, or bundled with, other applications.  For example, encryption-in-transit is required for many types of data.  An encryption service, for these types of data, would create a chicken-and-egg problem: data must be encrypted before it can be sent to the encryption service, but the encryption service must do the encryption.  In this example, the encryption libraries will likely be resident on the system that generates the sensitive data.  Nonetheless, it is important to explicitly call out the cryptographic functions that are performed within the architecture, to ensure that they are properly accounted for and not overlooked.",

WMS-produced maps are generally rendered in a pictorial format such as PNG, GIF or JPEG, or occasionally as vector-based graphical elements in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) or Web Computer Graphics Metafile (WebCGM) formats.  \nThis International Standard defines three operations: one returns service-level metadata; another returns a map whose geographic and dimensional parameters are well-defined; and an optional third operation returns information about particular features shown on a map. Web Map Service operations can be invoked using a standard web browser by submitting requests in the form of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). The content of such URLs depends on which operation is requested. In particular, when requesting a map the URL indicates what information is to be shown on the map, what portion of the Earth is to be mapped, the desired coordinate reference system, and the output image width and height. When two or more maps are produced with the same geographic parameters and output size, the results can be accurately overlaid to produce a composite map. The use of image formats that support transparent backgrounds (e.g. GIF or PNG) allows underlying maps to be visible. Furthermore, individual maps can be requested from different servers.

The SvcV-4 is not prescriptive as the organization relationships of  query repositories (by user, by organization, by role, etc.) but does point to the specifications listed in the Service Portfolio Management Tool (SPMT) for guidance (and once CDP approved, conformance requirement) in the applications or services that present query repositories.    In doing so, it encourages search criteria management services to operate in a manner that promotes establishment and provisioning of stored queries for sharing and use by disparate systems and users across the  Enterprise.",

For business applications, data validation can be defined through declarative data integrity rules, or procedure-based business rules. Data that does not conform to these rules will negatively affect business process execution. Therefore, data validation should start with business process definition and set of business rules within this process. Rules can be collected through the requirements capture exercise. The simplest data validation verifies that the characters provided come from a valid set. For example, that data stored as YYYYMMDDHHMM have exactly 12 digits and  the MM is between 01 and 12 inclusive. A more sophisticated data validation routine would check to see the user had entered a valid country code, i.e., that the number of digits entered matched the convention for the country or area specified.

There are also data analytics \"engines\" - i.e., tools that run data analytics algorithms (e.g., HDFS/MapReduce) and tools for creating algorithms (e.g., OpenNLP, NLTK, SharpNLP, etc.).  This is really too wide a category, and I would recommend that it be further decomposed into tools/rules engines and rules/algorithms.

                    "TagNotes_Service Description": "Rectification is a process of geometrically correcting an image so that it can be represented on a planar surface with a standard coordinate system.  This is often done to make an image geometrically conform to other images acquired from other perspectives.  This supports applications such as image/video mosaicking (combining multiple photographic images with overlapping fields of view to produce a larger, apparently seamless image), change detection, and multisensor data fusion.\n\nIt is also done to make an image or multiple images conform to a map, often for geographic information system (GIS) purposes. A common method for this service is to associate geolocations with pixels on an image.  The image pixels are then resampled to place them in into a common map coordinate system. \n\nAnother important application in which a rectification service gets used is in performing an epipolar rectification to ensure that corresponding match points in a pair of stereo images are displaced only along a single axis.  This enables easier matching and analysis of corresponding points in stereo image pairs by reducing the pixel stereo offsets to lie entirely along a single preferred axis (the epipolar axis).\n\nThe Image rectification Service ingests at a minimum an image, and a description of the planar surface to be used in the rectification process.  In some instances, such as for epipolar rectification, the target planar surface is described entirely by a second image in a stereo pair.  Automatic point correspondence matching establishes the required rectification transformation.  In other instances, such as orthorectification, it is common to supply either a reference image and a corresponding digital elevation map (DEM) or a reference image pair such as is found in a Digital Point Positioning Data Base (DPPDB). The DEM is used in performing the rectification transformation to minimize unsightly image artifacts that can affect a rectification done on perspective images in cases where no information about underlying terrain is supplied.  The simplest input to a rectification service is an input image to be rectified with image support data and a specification of a horizontal plane surface.",

Any frame in the video stream can be used for precision targeting or other precision position extraction applications.  \n\nThe frames are also crudely mosaicked (i.e. they are all correctly geopositioned but may still have visible \"seams\" from small scene intensity changes during the collection).  These visible seams can be removed by a subsequent FMV mosaicking process that blends image intensities across frame boundaries.\n\nThe FMV georegistration service ingests a stream of FMV frames and either reference imagery with associated reference DEMs or reference DPPDB.  If the quality of the FMV collection metadata is poor (such as is common from small UAVs or mini UAVs), the FMV georegistration service can optionally ingest point correspondences between the 1st frame in the FMV stream and the reference imagery in order to initiate the georegistration process.\n\nOnce the process starts, the service updates the FMV collection metadata for every frame based on a Kalman filter estimation of sensor position and attitude that is augmented by periodic automatic extractions of matching point correspondences between selected frames and the reference imagery.",

A MASINT processing service is often invoked to do SAR complex image pair formation in such a manner that a common frequency aperture is employed.\n\nSpecial condition image formation is only one example of a SAR MASINT processing service.  Other SAR MASINT processing of a different type is crucial to producing other types of SAR MASINT products.\n\nSimilarly, MASINT processing services are used to generate certain hyperspectral MASINT products from raw hyperspectral collections.
